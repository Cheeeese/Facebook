Homework 4 CodePath: Photo Transitions from Facebook Projects

This is an iOS demo that creates an example app using Swift to create animations and gestures based on an example app (Tumblr).  I utilized the example step by step Tutorials in the [CodePath Week 4 Project Folder] (http://courses.codepath.com/courses/ios_for_designers/unit/4#!assignment) to create this app.  

Time spent: ~8 hours developing required pieces

Completed user stories:
* [x] A user can tap on a photo in the news feed to expand the photo full screen.
* [x] A user can tap on the Done button to animate the photo back into its position in the news feed.
* [x] A user can scroll of the full screen photo, and the background should start to become transparent, revealing the feed.
* [x] If the user scrolls a large amount and releases, the full screen photo should dismiss.
* [x] Optional: The user can zoom the full screen photo
* [ ] Optional: The user can page through the other photos in full screen mode.
